                        <p class = "candidate-description"> “You don’t have to go far to find greatness, just wake up and look in the mirror.” These words I spoke at my high school graduation ceremony continue to light a fire inside of me today. It’s a mantra that I hold for myself and love to share with others who are looking for power within. This message embodies the legacy I plan to leave at the University of Cincinnati; to empower the UC community as they venture on their journey and aid in displaying their greatness to the world.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "candidate-description">	At the start of my expedition into the Bearcat community, I was immersed in thousands of avenues to grow as a leader. Through the Darwin T. Turner Scholarship Program, African American Cultural & Resource Center’s Transitions Program, and Student Government Mentorship Program, I was surrounded by a plethora of dedicated and spirited leaders who equipped me with invaluable resources. Inspired by the call to action, I started my courageous journey in student involvement as one of the first Chairs of Equity & Inclusion for the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences from Tribunal, where I brought awareness to the lack of diversity in our admissions and educated my peers on ways to support their fellow classmates of color. Next, I continued my journey by becoming involved with the Undergraduate Student Government as a whole. Through my time in the organization, I have been blessed with the opportunities to serve as Executive Director of Equity & Inclusion, a Senator At-Large, and Speaker of the Senate. From these experiences and more, I found my passion in dedicating the platform and voice I have to make space for all student voices to be heard and leaving this University better than when I found it in 2018.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "candidate-description">	As I continue to navigate my time in undergrad, I have reflected on the moments that have brought me to the present and learned about the various identities beneath the Red & Black we hold so dear to our hearts. As Casey and I embark on this venture, we ask for your help in holding us to the highest standard of excellence and listening to your fellow Bearcats. The journey ahead requires us to grow more than we have before and we will show you why we deserve to be next to serve our student body. 
                        </p>
                        <p class = "candidate-description">	We look forward to showing you over the next two weeks what we have next for the University of Cincinnati to address the needs of our fellow peers. Building off the legacy that many leaders have poured into our 203-year-old university, we have researched and developed a platform that will increase access to invaluable resources, grow our inclusive efforts, unify our community, and engage our spirits. Next is Now, and we’re ready to show you what’s next.

                        <p class = "candidate-description"> My time as an undergraduate student at the University of Cincinnati has been monumental in exploring my identity, discovering the type of imprint I wanted to leave in certain spaces, and enjoying the experience as it unfolds before me. As our University continues to give the opportunity for students to make legacies and blaze the trail for future Bearcats, we have moved forward with an innovative lense and progressive mindset where the only way ahead is looking at what’s next.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "candidate-description">When I started here at UC, I thought I carried only one identity with me–a student. However, throughout various involvements like being a Student Orientation Leader, Student Ambassador, to holding positions within organizations such as Bearcat Buddies or Sister Outsiders, to serving in Student Government as a Blue Ash Tribunal Senator and a Senator-At-Large, I learned that I also carried the identity of an educator, a leader, a changemaker, a support system, and a friend. Each of these spaces sculpted me into someone I would have looked up to when I was a young girl, or wished to be in middle school. I aim to continue growing and constantly surprising myself as to what I am capable of doing.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "candidate-description">But hand in hand with holding these positions, I have also carried a good deal of imposter syndrome. I am someone, regardless of how much experience I hold, who questions whether or not I am good enough or belong in a particular space. Wondering and second-guessing if I am not qualified or am lacking in comparison to others around me. I want to be someone who battles those thoughts and internalized beliefs and encourages others at UC that they do indeed have the right to occupy space, have a voice in the room, possess the passion and ambition to pursue whatever they set out to do.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "candidate-description">I also harbor the belief to remain curious and cognizant of the world as well as the people and environment I am a part of. In doing so, I have taken the initiative beyond classes to find spaces outside of my own community, to listen and learn from other perspectives that differ from my own. Acknowledge some of the privileges I possess and also how I can support and advocate other Bearcats around me. 
                        </p>
                        <p class = "candidate-description">With that being said, I am prepared to create lasting and sustainable work for this University. To continue the amazing initiatives that the leaders before me have paved and made available for students and ensure that they remain a part of this campus. To reach out to any student, listen to their stories, be a resource and help them meet success in their journey as a Bearcat. All that to say, I am here to look ahead and lead with empathy, enthusiasm, and empowerment. I am ready to make next, now.

                              <p>This initiative would impact all students by increasing access to news resources that can be utilized for academic studies and research. Secondly, increasing access to these resources encourages students to stay informed on current events and promote civic engagement in university related issues.</p>
                              <h4>Implementation</h4>
                              <p>It's important that we are continuously looking at incremental changes that can increase affordability and access to different resources that impact academia. We aim to conduct a survey to ensure we provide resources we know our students will be inclined to utilize as well as see the various ways in which these resources would impact our community. Following these efforts, we will establish funding for the university subscription to these resources and working with various offices to promote their access. </p>
